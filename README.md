# Graph-Streaming-Algorithms
Streaming algorithms are approaches towards solving problems which involve processing of large amounts of data, such as in massive graph network analyses. 
Storing the entire information about the graph can lead to the need of alloting a lot of storage space for the same, causing the approach to be very impractical and at times infeasible ("Memory Limit Exceeded" in the language of Competitive Programming).
Hence, we use streaming algorithms for such problems where the input is regarded as a continuous stream of data and the problem is solved in real time.
Such algorithms used for graphs are very popular, including construction of sparsifiers, optimal spanning trees, etc. 

Expected timeline: 
July : Learning about the streaming and sublienar algorithms
August: Working on implemetation of a few popular algorithms with practical use
September: Furhter reading and theoretical approacehs towards new alogirthms
